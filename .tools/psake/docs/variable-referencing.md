Since **psake** is written in PowerShell, all variables follow the PowerShell scoping rules (PS> help about_scope).  All the variables declared in the "properties" function have the "script" level scope and any variables declared within a "task" function are local variables.  

This means you can reference the "properties" variables from any "task" function but all variables declared within "task" function are not accessible from other "task" functions in the build script. 

The following is an example build script that uses a property variable from 2 different task functions:

```powershell
properties {
  $x = 1
}

task default -depends TaskA, TaskB

task TaskA {
  '$x = ' + $x
}

task TaskB {
 '$x = ' + $x
}
```

The output from running the above build is:

```
Executing task: TaskA
$x = 1
Executing task: TaskB
$x = 1

Build Succeeded!

```

Sometimes you may want/need to set a variable or update a property within a task and then refer to that variable/property from another task.

The following example build script shows how to do that using the "script" scope modifier

```powershell
properties {
  $x = 1
}

task default -depends TaskA, TaskB

task TaskA {
  $script:x = 100
  '$x = ' + $script:x
}

task TaskB {
 '$x = ' + $script:x
}
```

The output from the above script:

```
Executing task: TaskA
$x = 100
Executing task: TaskB
$x = 100

Build Succeeded!

```

The following example does not update a property, it sets a "script" level variable ("y") within one task and references it in another task.

```powershell
task default -depends TaskA, TaskB

task TaskA {
  $script:y = 100
  '$y = ' + $script:y
}

task TaskB {
 '$y = ' + $script:y
}
```

The output from the above build script:

```
Executing task: TaskA
$y = 100
Executing task: TaskB
$y = 100

Build Succeeded!

In case you create a variable with script scope, the variable is kept inside the psake module. This means, that if you run Invoke-Psake again, the variable is available. Thatâ€™s why variables with script scope should be used carefully. Consider them as global variables accessible for all scripts running in psake.
