# Collaboration
RampUp is an open source project, licenced under Apache Licence. I truely believe that it can be a solid foundation for various .NET systems.

### I accept Pull Requests
I write RampUp in my free time and I've open sourced it in a search for active collaboration. If you find a bug or a spelling mistake, I'm glad if you create an issue. I'm much more happier though, if you spend some time and create a well prepared Pull Request. As Linus says, 'Talk is cheap. Show me the code'. If you find an improper behavior, a PR could be just a test isolating the issue. Once we have it isolated, it'll be much easier to successfully finish the PR by applying a fix in it.

### Squashing Pull Requests
I'm strongly opinionated about Git workflows and I'm very glad that GitHub introduced an option for [squashing the PR](https://github.com/blog/2141-squash-your-commits). So far I it looks like a good tool and will be applied to all the PRs

### Versioning
The project is much too young to publish artifacts & apply versioning. For now, it will use 'bleeding edge' approach accepting PRs directly to the master.

### Collaboration process
This document can be a subject for a PR as well :)
